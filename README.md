# Support-Vector-Machine
A classic problem in the field of pattern recognition is that of handwritten digit recognition. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can correctly identify the digit (between 0-9) written in an image, submitted by a user via a scanner, a tablet, or other digital devices. We are required to develop a model using Support Vector Machine which should correctly classify the handwritten digits based on the pixel values given as features.
For this problem, we use the MNIST data which is a large database of handwritten digits where we have pixel values of each digit along with its label.
